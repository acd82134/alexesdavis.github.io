            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Five years ago, as a high school senior, I found myself inundated
                in fear and anxiety as I began to explore my options as an
                upcoming first-generation college student. Despite my
                engulfment in apprehension regarding post-secondary education,
                my interest in attending the University of Georgia shined
                through the abyss of uncertainty and self-doubt. I was
                enchanted by the perpetuity of greatness that the university
                exemplifies through the pillars of wisdom, justice, and
                moderation. Additionally, a Saturday spent between the hedges
                certainly piqued my interest and further fueled my excitement!<br></br>

                Presently, as a senior psychology student, I can admit that
                while my major and career interests have changed over the years,
                my sentiments of admiration and respect for this university have
                remained unscathed. With a Mental Health Counseling program that
                is well-rounded through its emphasis on social justice and
                highly reputable with a top three nationwide ranking, the
                decision to stay at this illustrious university is both simple
                and self-evident.Amid the exemplary graduate programs available
                at the University of Georgia, I personally resonate the most
                with the Mental Health Counseling program because I am passionate
                about helping marginalized populations rediscover their joy and
                power. I have dreams of advocating for change in available
                resources and mental health policies that could significantly
                reduce the staggering disparities seen today amongst varying
                socioeconomic and racial groups. It is a harrowing reality that
                mental health incongruencies exist within intersectional groups,
                such as individuals with disabilities, the homeless, women, and
                nearly every racial minority. My career interests of lowering
                the percentage of untreated mental illnesses amongst
                incarcerated African American&apos;s in juvenile detention centers,
                aligns with the sustainable service demonstrated by the Mental
                Health Counseling programs focus on social equitability.<br></br>

                As Oprah Winfrey once said, <q>Where there is no struggle, there
                is no strength.</q> I love this quote because I know first-hand
                what it means to struggle. From a retroactive hardship
                withdrawal to working three jobs as a full-time student, my
                college career has irrefutably contained some of my largest
                tribulations to date. A further consequence of being pulled in
                so many different directions by the stressors of life was the
                decline of my GPA. Even in the face of personal and familial
                hardships, I welcomed the challenge and used my desire for
                success as fuel to change the course of my academic path. With
                a newly invigorated tenacity for school, I was able to earn a
                spot on the Dean&apos;s List for the Summer of 2018, work as an
                intern for both Focus+Fragile Kids and Gwinnett United in Drug
                Education, chosen to serve as one of the 36 representatives of
                the Arch Society and inducted as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha
                Sorority Incorporated.<br></br>

                My internship responsibilities included supervising a group of
                15 children with developmental and/or physical disabilities,
                presenting feedback on Gwinnett county&apos;s compliance check rates
                for the quarter, and recording a radio infomercial regarding the
                prevalence of prescription drug abuse in the youth today.
                Through my membership with the Arch society, serving as an
                Athens Clarke Middle School mentor and volunteering as a
                certified peer support specialist for iPrevail Mental Health
                Solutions, I am honored to have been granted the responsibility
                to humbly serve my community. Direct examples of my service in
                these organizations include acting as an official
                representative and goodwill ambassador of the University of
                Georgia, facilitating the beginning of the end of isolated
                children in our school systems, and contributing to easily
                accessible mental health treatment for individuals worldwide.
                As an up and coming helping professional, what better way to
                assist others achieve wellness and equality than through
                humble service. As an Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority member, it is
                my goal to embody our motto, <q>By culture, by merit,</q> through
                selfless action to anyone in need. I know in my heart that I
                have what it takes to thrive in this graduate program through
                my resilience in my undergraduate career as well as my
                overwhelming desire to be of service to all mankind.
